    <article>
      About appearance: A minimalistic guitar for those who don't like bright
      colors. The matte coat on this guitar looks expensive but there is one
      problem: any pollution is clearly visible on this coating, like dust or
      marks from dirty hands.

    <article>
      About appearance: An interesting pattern and a combination of black and
      red colors gives guitar aggressive look: it's just what you need for
      metal! The body is glossy, so various dirt and scratches are not so
      visible. And it is possible to screw the tremolo lever. Let's compare
      these two guitars:

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <article>
      Both guitars are quite suitable for heavy music. But the brown IBANEZ
      GRG121DX-WNF has 2 more frets and also it has larger gauge strings (this
      increases the tension of the strings, which is good for riffs on the sixth
      string, but worse for solos on the first thin strings). Guitar humbuckers
      are different: will it affect the sound? I checked it! From the link below
      you can listen to me playing these guitars. I used a NUX MIGHTY 30SE DSP
      AMP with a distortion.
